        WHAT IS FATTIES CLUB?
      </h2>
      <p className="text-2xl text-white mt-2 mb-6 ">
        Fatties Club is a community of like-minded people who have the same
        goal: to lose weight, but struggle with it. <br /> We personally know
        how hard it is to lose weight by yourself, without the support of your
        family or friends. <br /> Fatties Club provides you with accountability
        and a support system that will help you with your fitness
        transformation.
